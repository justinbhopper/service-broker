- Message size test:
	- Haven't written this because I don't feel we can get away with syncing only using the data that came from the row that was written
	- ^ this means we will likely need to go to an API to grab data anyways, which makes it pointless to store extra data
- Async handlers:
	- We can handle each message before continuing the loop or we can spawn tasks that run async while the loop continues
